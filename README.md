# Hello-World
CNC - Grbl and Gcode senders
I am making a small CNC milling machine using hardware shop parts and Stepper motors from old Printers and Faxes. I have used Arduino uno with Grbl 0.9j loaded and a CNC shield. I wrote my own GCode sender with Delphi3 on an old Windows XP compaq, it works well and I can add and change features easily. To my surprise it works perfectly well on my new Acer ASpire with Win 7 64bit but limited to usb virtual ports com1 to com9. The sender uses byte counting so the Grbl buffer does not overflow. After DXF files from the internet are converted to GCode files, I have program to check and manipulate them. With this utility I can visualize the XY plane, re scale to fit my machine, renumber the lines, change any inch code to mm and check that codes are valid for the Grbl. Then I dont expect to have any further problem, it works very well. The homing works very well after I put filter caps and 7414 Shmidt triggers on the micro switch leads. The only issue I have is an ocassional error ID33 on the G2 or G3 X Y I J command.
